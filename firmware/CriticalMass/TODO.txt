****TODO****
  This list is for tasks which are not substantial enough for a GitHub issue.
  Its more of a working scratchpad for cleanup and alpha level development issues and ideas.

--HIGH PRIORITY--

  Update libraries
  Move obsolete test code out of main

--LOW PRIORITY--

  Use hardware alias masks to set port data direction registers and pull ups
  Rename functions (more descriptive, less abbreviations)
  Add function DOCUMENTATION
  Add variable DOCUMENTATION
  Add License Link
  Clean up comments - Tab spacing, capitalization, punctuation, clarity, location (above code or to the right of it)
