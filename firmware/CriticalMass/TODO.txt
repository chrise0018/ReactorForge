****TODO****
  This list is for tasks which are not substantial enough for a GitHub issue.
  Its more of a working scratchpad for cleanup and alpha level development issues.

--HIGH PRIORITY--

  Update libraries
  Move obsolete test code out of main

--LOW PRIORITY--

  Use hardware alias masks to set port data direction registers and pull ups
  Rename functions (more descriptive, less abbreviations)
  Add function DOCUMENTATION
  Add variable DOCUMENTATION
  Clean up comments - Tab spacing, capitalization, punctuation, clarity, location (above code or to the right of it)
