****TODO****
  This list is for tasks which are not substantial enough for a GitHub issue.
  Its more of a working scratchpad for cleanup and alpha level development issues.

--HIGH PRIORITY--

  Update libraries
  Move obsolete test code out of main

  in incr_freq line:
    if (ontime == byte_temp)
    should be (ontime >= byte_temp) ??? Needs tested
    Currently I am only ever incrementing by 1 "incr_freq(1)" but if I was to increment by more than one this would be an issue.

--LOW PRIORITY--

  Use hardware alias masks to set port data direction registers and pull ups
  Rename functions (more descriptive, less abbreviations)
  Add function DOCUMENTATION
  Add variable DOCUMENTATION
  Clean up comments - Tab spacing, capitalization, punctuation, clarity, location (above code or to the right of it)


--HARDWARE--

  Add hardware pull up for IGBT_FAULT_PIN
