****IDEA Scratchpad****


Use a boot loader
	One port to program and monitor serial data
  Additional programmer not needed
	Will have to add a usb to serial chip and passives to main board
  Will make firmware updates / hacking easier for end user

Use an LCD with as serial backpack (i2s, spi, etc)
  Current LCD configuration uses 6 ports
  Will free up ports using a common bus
  Don't currently need the ports but its something to consider
	Simpler programing interface with standard libraries
  Slower refresh but that shouldn't matter
