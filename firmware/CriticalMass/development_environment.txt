ReactorForge - Development Environment

https://atom.io + https://atom.io/packages/platomformio = frickin awesome

Arduino is a great prototyping platform and IDE. As a beginner, it can get you building projects faster than any other
platform out there. But eventually, the features that make it convenient and easy to use hold you back. It lacks many
features which make writing code quicker, easier, and have become quite standard in modern text editors. The next
logical step is to leave the Arduino IDE behind. We do that by working in a more fully-featured development environment.
Atom + PlatformIO is my new favorite open source cross-platform IDE. It even comes with the Arduino framework among
others. That lets you test drive it with a code structure you are familiar. When you are ready, you can remove the
training wheels and go full native C++. There is so much more I could brag about with both of these tools. But Iâ€™ll let
you discover the awesomeness yourself!
