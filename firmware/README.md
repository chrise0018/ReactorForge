ReactorForge Core (the main controller board) firmware is written in C. The projects presented here will use AVR Studio 6. 

Firmware can be updated with an ICSP programer via the on board programing header or by putting the unit in DFU (Device Firmware Update) mode and uploading the new firmware image over a serial connection.

Some older revisions were written in basic using the MCS Electronics BASCOM-AVR compiler, those versions are not supported or active.
