## Project Description
The ReactorForge project is an open source hardware platform for high power induction heating, designed for heavy use and reliable performance in realworld applications.

Using fewer discreet components than most commercial induction heaters, the ReactorForge has less failure points and is easy to assemble. It is an open source project with all plans, schematics and code available under the creative commons BY-SA 4.0 license. This not only benefits the maker community and improves future designs but also makes self repair a possibility for those who have purchased kits, rather than relying on expensive factory repairs to proprietary commercial units.

The ReactorForge will be made available in a raw kit form and an ARU (Almost Ready to Use) kit that can be assembled in just a couple hours. Learn about high power electronics while building an awesome machine. The same systems in an induction heater also drive many of todays modern advances such as electric vehicles, renewable energy power inverters, cutting edge research equipment, and much more. Whether your goals are academic or you want to start using an induction heater today the ReactorForge project brings that within reach.

The ReactorForge costs thousands less than equivalent commercial models with features that are not available anywhere else. It has an easy one button/pedal interface for those that want simple to use set and forget type operation. But for those that want full control there are powerful features that let you monitor and regulate opperation based on virtualy any parameter. And since the entire platform is open source you have a head start to hacking the core (main control board).

## Safety Notice and Disclamer
An induction heater is a high power device that should be treated with similar respect to that of a welder. In addition the following saftey guidlines should be observed:

* Don't wear metal jewelry, especially rings near the work coil. Heating can occur a few inches from the coil depending on its geometry.
* Be cautious if you have metal implants, they too could heat up if held near the work coil.
* If you have a pacemaker or defibrillator never use, be near, or look at this machine when it is in operation.
* Keep electronics such as phones, cameras, etc. at least 12 inches from the work coil while in opperation to avoid damage said devices.
* Never touch the work coil, particularly where it exits the machine. Although it is isolated from dangerous mains current, like a welder, there is still high power RF present. You could get an RF burn or a painful jolt. Holding metal that touches or shorts out the work coil is NOT a hazard.

The hazards are similar but not limited to that of home induction cooktops. We hold no responsibility or liability for injury to person or damage to property should you choose to build and operate one of these machines. If you feel you are not qualified to build or operate an induction heater find someone qualified and willing to assist you.
