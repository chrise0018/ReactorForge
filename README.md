## Project Description
The goal of ReactorForge project is to produce an open source high power induction heater, designed for heavy use and long life that anyone can assemble.

Using less discreet parts than most commercial induction heaters, the ReactorForge is easy to assemble and has fewer parts to fail. It is an open source project with all plans, schematics and code available to anyone. This not only benefits the maker community and improve future designs but also makes self repair a possibility rather than relying on expensive factory repairs to proprietary commercial equipment.

The ReactorForge will be made available in a raw kit form or an ARU Kit (Almost Ready to Use) that can be assembled in just hours. Learn about high power electronics while building an awesome machine. The same systems in an induction heater also drive many of todays modern advances such as electric vehicles, renewable energy power inverters, cutting edge research equipment, and much more. Whether your goal is to learn or start using your induction heater today consider the ReactorForge!
