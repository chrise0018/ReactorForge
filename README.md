## Project Description
The ReactorForge project is an open source hardware platform for high power induction heating, designed for heavy use and reliable performance in realworld applications.

Using less discreet parts than most commercial induction heaters, the ReactorForge is easy to assemble and has fewer failure points. It is an open source project with all plans, schematics and code available under the Creative Commons License. This not only benefits the maker community and improves future designs but also makes self repair a possibility for those who have purchased kits, rather than relying on expensive factory repairs to proprietary commercial units.

The ReactorForge will be made available in a raw kit form or an ARU Kit (Almost Ready to Use) that can be assembled in just hours. Learn about high power electronics while building an awesome machine. The same systems in an induction heater also drive many of todays modern advances such as electric vehicles, renewable energy power inverters, cutting edge research equipment, and much more. Whether your goals are academic or you want to start using an induction heater today the ReactorForge project brings all that within reach.
