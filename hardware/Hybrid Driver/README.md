ReactorForge - Hybrid Driver
============

Hybrid Driver is a dual IGBT module gate driver based on the Powerex M57962L hybrid IC for driving n-channel IGBTs. This driver is an ideal choice for high power inverter applications such as that in the ReactorForge induction heater. It has the capability to drive up to 400A IGBT modules and features short circuit protection via built in desaturation detectors, keeping the system safe during harsh operation.
