MKII - Core Upgrade
============

This was an upgrade to the prototype using the old tank voltage feedback, PLL style control with gate drive transformer driven IGBTs. The upgrade allowed the unit to run on inverter current feedback with no PLL (all digital phase control performed by the microcontroller) and make use of the new hybrid ic drivers with over current protection.
