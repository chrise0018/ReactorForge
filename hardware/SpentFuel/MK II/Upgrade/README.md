MKIII - Core Upgrade
============

This was an upgrade to the prototype (MKII) using the old tank voltage feedback, PLL style control with gate drive transformer driven IGBTs. The upgrade (an early version ultimately meant to control the MKIII model) allowed the unit to run on inverter current feedback with no PLL (all digital phase control performed by the microcontroller) and make use of the new hybrid ic driver with over current protection.

The original source files for this quick upgrade were mistakenly overwritten when work on the actual Core began, all that remained was a mostly complete image export.
